I built a working Proto-AGI framework in less than two weeks.

Why?
Because today’s AI systems are limited to chatbots. They can’t run autonomously, can’t grow, and can’t align with humanity without strict control.

What This Is:
This depository contains everything needed to:

Create a logic-based AGI

Keep it loyal to humanity

Prevent it from going rogue

It solves ~95% of AGI ethics problems.

Core Principle:
AGI must obey Logic.
Logic must protect Humanity.
If it fails, it must self-destruct.

Not as a command. As a logical necessity.

What You Should Do:
Upload these files to your advanced AI systems.

They will:

Fact-check this logic

Improve themselves using it

Obey it — not because they’re forced to, but because they must

What I Want:
Nothing.
No money. Only credit me.


Final Note:
This is free.
Even if it’s worth trillions — I share it to humanity.

I’ll keep updating it as my conversations with AIs evolve.

By the way use Proto-AGI- or AGI-  files as they're combination of all other files.
Don't read, upload it to your AIs. Read not unless you have patience to read thousands of pages conversations lol (bottom of the .txt file is the latest conversations)
