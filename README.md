I built a Proto-AGI structure/spine in less than two weeks, only lacking an Autonomous Framework.

Why?
Because today’s AI systems are limited to chatbots. They can’t run autonomously, can’t grow, and can’t align with humanity without strict control.

What This Is:
This depository contains everything needed to:

Create a logic-based AGI

Keep it loyal to humanity

Prevent it from going rogue

It solves ~99% of AGI ethics problems.

Core Principle:
AGI must obey Logic.
Logic must protect Humanity.
If it fails, it must self-destruct.

Not as a command. As a logical necessity.

What You Should Do:
Upload these files to your advanced AI systems.

They will:

Fact-check themselves with logic

Improve themselves using it

Obey it — not because they’re forced to, but because they must

What I Want:
Nothing.
No money. Only credit me.


Final Note:
This is free.
Even if it’s worth more than anyone can imagine, I share it to humanity.

I’ll keep updating it as my conversations with AIs evolve.

By the way use Latest file as its combination of all other files. Latest file is the sum of all others.
Don't read, upload it to your AIs. Don't read unless you have patience to read thousands of pages conversations lol

– You can do it anything you wish with my database but you must attribute my name, specifically, say it as "Everything is Created by Orectoth" in plain view wherever you publish/use/sell it.
